# Bash
**What is Bash?**
Bash is a program that lets you tell your computer what to do using text commands. Think of it like giving instructions step by step.
- It’s like talking to your computer instead of clicking icons.
- You type commands, and Bash runs them.
- You can also write scripts—a list of commands saved in a file—so the computer can do things automatically.

**Bash in super simple terms**

- **Command**: 	Something you tell the computer to do. Example: ls (lists files)
- **Script**:	A file with many commands saved together, like a “to-do list” for the computer
- **Variable**: A “box” where you store information. Example: name="Alice"
- **Echo**:	Tells the computer to show something on the screen. Example: echo "Hello"
- **If-Else**:	Making decisions. “If this happens, do that; else, do something else.”
- **Loop**:	Doing the same thing multiple times automatically.
